# email_md

## Before you start

```bash
pip install markdownify
```

### Fastmail

1. Click "Settings" then "Privacy and Security"
2. Click "New App Password"
3. Give it a name like "email_md"
4. Choose "Mail, Contacts, & Calendars" (or just "IMAP")
5. Click "Generate Password"
6. Under "Your new password for email_md is:" copy that password
7. Put the password somewhere secure like a password keeper, I use BitWarden

Figure out the IMAP server. 

For Fastmail it's `imap.fastmail.com` and Port `993`.
